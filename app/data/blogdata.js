      <h1>Who Is AvaLikesBread?</h1>
      <p>I grew up in the UK, gaming and music heavily impacting me. I loved games like watchdogs and watchdogs 2 growing up and It made me obsessed with hacking in the modern day, with me wanting
      to pursue something in that industry professionally. Cut to now; I'm learning hacking from close friends and getting better at my craft day by day. This blog is meant to help with my own
      understanding of these concepts im learning, whilst explaining them in a simple way for other people to understand who also want to get into this field.</p>`,
